The concept of leadership can be traced back to the very beginning of time in the garden of Eden where the first man, Adam had dominion over every living thing in the garden. Since then, kings have begun to appear. In every gathering, a king was appointed at every rally. Leaders were usually appointed from birth or from Godâ€™s instruction. In the Middle Ages, leaders were authoritarian, intimidating, fearful, and rare. As a result of the Renaissance, leadership has moved from the kings alone to parliament which consisted of simple men.

Jean-Jacques in 1762 made us know Authority comes from people who give up their personal freedom for their safety and security.
