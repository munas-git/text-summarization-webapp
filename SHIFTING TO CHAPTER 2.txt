***BRIEF HISTORY OF AI***
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of research that includes technology emulating or attempting to clone the intellectual quotient of humans. Natural language processing, computer vision, self-driving vehicles, fraud detection and prevention, and many more applications can benefit from AI. AI as a subject of study may be traced back to a symposium held at Dartmouth in Hanover, New Hampshire in 1956. Although the goal to create an artificially intelligent system had been devised, it was not simple to implement, which lead to a drop in government financing, this resulted in a period known as the "AI winter," which lasted from 1970 to 1980. Following many AI achievements, such as when IBM's Deep Blue became the first computer to defeat a chess champion, and when an AI system won the game show "Jeopardy," research began to accelerate. Ever since then, AI has been found useful in several fields of study and will continue to remain relevant.    As earlier stated, this project is made possible due to the NLP branch of AI.

***SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM***
With the advent of computer literacy, we have so much information in circulation. Ranging from phones, texts, social media platforms, law enforcement agencies, churches, school study materials etc. Looking at the school study materials for instance, there’s usually a tremendous amount of course load to read and limited time to do so, to enable them take tests and exams in turn. We as academics already know that not every detail in the material is usually relevant. Although it’s important to look closely to find the relevant details. This project is geared at providing a long-term solution of extracting the key underlying information embedded in this heavily detailed content made for consumption. In the sense the material is fed into the system by either copying and pasting, manual upload or drag and drop, the system then assimilates and digests the content with respect to time and space and then extracts the key information necessary for consumption by the reader. Moreso, the system also enables auto-detection of the language of the said body of text, summarize to other languages, detect topic of discussion of any text entered for summary. It removes the constraint of solely English language summarization as other systems have and puts the choice of language in the hands of the user.

Along with the pursuit of more informative and coherent summaries with factual consistency, attention to knowledge embedding as an incorporation module for document summarizers to enhance model performance and improve summary quality gathered pace. In this paper, we surveyed the state-of-the-art approaches to embedding knowledge into document summarization models. To explicitly review each representative knowledge embedding approach in document summarization, we proposed taxonomies for
