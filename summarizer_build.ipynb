Since then, kings have begun to appear. In every gathering, a king was appointed at every rally. Leaders were usually appointed from birth or from God’s instruction. In the Middle Ages, leaders were authoritarian, intimidating, fearful, and rare. As a result of the Renaissance, leadership has moved from the kings alone to parliament which consisted of simple men. This left a question, where did the authority come from? Isn't it from God? Jean-Jacques in 1762 made us know Authority comes from people who give up their personal freedom for their safety and security. Anxiety, robbery, murder was the order of the day for leadership in the Middle Ages.
